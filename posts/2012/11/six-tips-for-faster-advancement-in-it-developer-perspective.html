<p>Recently I was asked to give a talk about working in the IT industry for the first year students. I was asked to represent our company (Saga) at technical level and after intensive thinking about the subject for presentation I came up with six tips for faster advancement in IT industry.</p>
<p>Those tips would have helped me a lot if I’ve heard them in the beginning of my career. I’ve been working in IT industry for about five years on a few enterprise-scale applications and I’ve advanced for that period from junior programmer to Solution Architect. So having that in mind I felt competent to give a few tips.</p>
<h2 id="choose-company-which-will-help-you-grow">Choose company which will help you grow</h2>
<p>You should choose your employer really carefully, especially at the beginning of your career. You’ll want an employer that will help you grow, improve your skills and gain valuable experience.</p>
<p>You should set a long-term goal. Something you want to achieve in the future and keep that goal in your mind at all times. Every job should set you closer for reaching that goal. And when you finally reach it you will feel a lot better about yourself, you will know that you earned it and that you are capable of defining your own future.</p>
<p>Your employer should challenge you with the size and creativity of projects. He should help you improve your skills and gain new skills relevant to your long-term goal.</p>
<h2 id="find-a-mentor">Find a mentor</h2>
<p>When you start working at new job you will want to learn your job as quickly as possible. It will be much easier if there is someone to teach you, someone who is already good at it. When you start working at new company your new employer should provide a mentor for you, but if that is not the case you must find it on your own.</p>
<p>I suggest that you ask the most experienced colleague to be your mentor. Explain to him that you want to improve your skills and get into the job as quickly as possible, and that you find him the best example of what you want to accomplish. Using this approach you will acknowledge him as an expert in the area and as someone you professionally admire, so hopefully he will accept to be your mentor.</p>
<h2 id="stay-on-top-of-things">Stay on top of things</h2>
<p>IT industry is very dynamic. We can see new products and technologies come out on a daily basis, so if you want to be very good at your job you must “stay on top of things”. In other words you must learn new stuff continually.</p>
<p>One good way to stay informed is to follow the most influential people in your area. You can do this on social networks or simply by subscribing to RSS feeds for most relevant blogs.</p>
<p>I can recommend Google Reader for that purpose. If you don’t know where to start simply open Google Reader, click on link “Browse for stuff” and select a few bundles most relevant to your field. Bundles are collections of quality blogs for various fields that Google selected for us.</p>
<p>Once you make checking for new things your usual practice you will notice how you know everything what happens at your field. When new library comes out, when the library you use gets updated, when the interesting job position opens and so on.</p>
<h2 id="write-a-blog">Write a blog</h2>
<p>Absolutely every software developer should have a blog.</p>
<p>I saw this interesting remark on <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/">Scott Hanselman’s blog</a> and I couldn’t agree more. Here is my list of the best things about blogging:</p>
<ul>
<li>To write about subject you must really understand it. Well you don’t, but if you want people to understand what you want to say then you must. If you only partially understand a subject and you start to write about it you will soon enough find out that you can’t complete a few sentences.</li>
<li>Don’t forget about big problems you solved. When you find a challenging task and you successfully complete it write it down. Later at some point you may need to remember solution, or simply you can watch back and see what decisions you made and how much you improved over time.</li>
<li>How do you find solutions for your problems? Think about it, how many times you found a solution to your problem at someones blog? I know I did a lot, especially for some tricky problems, problems that require elaboration. So, write down solution for a tricky problem, chances are someone will have the same problem as you do. In that way you will repay your debt to community which helped you and you will feel a lot better, I promise.</li>
<li>Blog is very good addition to your CV. Did you ever ask yourself what will your potential employer see if he enters your name in search engine? Facebook profile with some compromising pictures? Tweets when you were in a bad mood? Why not showcase your rock solid problem solving skill? By looking at your blog your potential employer will see all kinds of problems you solved over time and he will get to know you really good from professional aspect.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="work-on-personal-projects">Work on personal projects</h2>
<p>Always attempt to stretch your limits. To do that you must attempt something that is not your  usual field of work, something creative. How about creating a game? Something old and simple and yet challenging (tetris, minesweeper, battleships, sudoku). Or you might start working on some opensource project. In the end you will have a good time and learn a lot from it.</p>
<h2 id="organize-your-time">Organize your time</h2>
<p>Essentially a measure of your success at work will be how many things you get done. You can be a great expert at some field, but if you don’t know how to organize your time effectively you may not get the recognition you deserve.</p>
<p>Here is a list of a few good tips I came across over time:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t read your email in the morning. If you do you might time-travel to afternoon. Chances are you will find some emails you must answer, or you might engage a discussion over email.</li>
<li>Find your most productive time period in a day and use it to the maximum. For example I found out that I’m the most productive from 9:00-12:00. So I try to put all important things in that period and less important things (mail reading, surfing) afterwards. This is simply a good strategy to get the most out of your time.</li>
<li>Don’t get burned! In your free time try not to look at the screen, try to relax and spend some time with your friends and family. You will feel a lot better and fresh after some quality time.</li>
</ul>
<p>So that’s it. That was the list of tips that helped me a lot throughout my career so far. Try them and see how it goes, they might work for you better then you think.</p>
<p>What do you think? Would you add some tips to this list?</p>
